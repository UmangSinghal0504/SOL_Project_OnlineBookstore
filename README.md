# 📚 SQL Project: Online Bookstore

This project showcases SQL querying skills using data from an **Online Bookstore**. It involves extracting insights and performing analysis on data across three interlinked CSV files: `Books.csv`, `Customers.csv`, and `Orders.csv`.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The project is built on three datasets:

- **Books.csv** — Contains book details (title, genre, price, stock, author, etc.)
- **Customers.csv** — Contains customer information (name, city, country, etc.)
- **Orders.csv** — Contains order data (order date, book ID, customer ID, quantity, etc.)

> These tables are connected using common fields like `Book_ID` and `Customer_ID`.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Basic SQL queries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- Grouping and joining tables
- Subqueries and nested logic
- Real-world analytical thinking
